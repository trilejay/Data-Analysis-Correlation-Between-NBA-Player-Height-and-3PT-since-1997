# NBA Player Height vs 3-Point Performance Analysis
# Overview
This project builds an end-to-end ETL pipeline to analyze the correlation between NBA player height and 3-point shooting performance since 1997. Data is extracted from Kaggle datasets and web scraping from BasketballReference â€“ cleaned, combined, and analyzed.
The results include visualizations showcasing the change in trends and correlation over time.

# Features
Data Extraction: Combined player height data from Kaggle with 3-point performance stats scraped from Basketball-Reference.
Data Transformation: Filtered outliers, removed duplicates, and normalized season formats for consistency.
Correlation Analysis: Calculated the correlation coefficient between player height and 3-point shooting percentage for each season.
Visualization: Trend-line analysis visualized on Power BI. Created scatter plots of correlations by season using Matplotlib.
Data Storage: Saved the cleaned dataset and correlation results into CSV and Excel formats.

# Technologies Used
Python: Core programming language
Pandas: Data manipulation and transformation
BeautifulSoup: Web scraping
Matplotlib: Data visualization
Power BI: Data visualization

# Results
The visual analysis shows a significant decrease in the correlation between NBA player height and 3-point field goal percentage, over the seasons.
Loss of data during cleaning and transformation process, as well as the validity of data that was scraped may lead to inaccuracies in the result.
